# Review after the term:
# Tuples -> The data that's inside of any tuples cannot be changed after created.
# Tuples -> Tuples are constant when the program are running.
# Tuples -> Tuples are usually used for menu items that would not need to be changed.

# List -> The inside data of any lists can be changed while the program is running.
# List -> Lists are like Arrays in C. Different data type can accomodate in every index.
# List -> In other words, the data in a list does not all have to be of the same data type.
# List -> can include both strings and integers but this may cause problems. It is not recommended.

# Dictionaries -> Dictionary can also be changed while the program is running.
# Dictionaries -> In Dictionaries, the index will not change if other rows of data are added or deleted.
# Dictionaries -> In Lists, the position of the items can change and therefore their index number will also change.
