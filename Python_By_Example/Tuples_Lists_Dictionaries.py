# Once a tuple is defined you cannot change what is stored in it.
# Tuples are usually for menu items that would not need to be changed.
# The contents of a List can be changed while the program is running and lists are one of the most common ways
# - to store a collection of data under one variable name in Python.
# List include different data types at the same type. But it is not recommended to use due to unwanted results.
# Arrays are used to store ONLY numbers in Python. In the other programming languages array corresponds
# -the Lists in Python.
# Dictionaries - the content of a dictionary can also be changed while the program is running.
# index of dictionary is not changed if other rows of data are added or deleted
# -while program is running unlike LIST.

# Tuple Declaration:

print(fruit_tuple.index("Apple"))
print(fruit_tuple.index("Banana"))
print(fruit_tuple.index("strawberry"))
print(fruit_tuple[0])
print(fruit_tuple[1])
print(fruit_tuple[2])

# List Declaration:
