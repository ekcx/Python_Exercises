# Python_Exercises
This repository will include Python code examples from the latest books. 

I am following "Python by Example - Learning to Program in 150 Challenges (Nichola Lacey)". You can find this book's link below on amazon. 

Practice makes perfect as we know. I am improving myself by answering code exercises on this book for now. 
During this process, I am making research deeply and also I am reading lots of document about Python to answer that questions.
Collecting knowledge from different sources is a crucial skill in the software industry. By doing this, I am tracing a serious path and taking considerable distance.

Thanks.
